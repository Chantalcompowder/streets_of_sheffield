					<h1>Why Is Culture Important?</h1> <h4>#streetsofsheffield</h4>
					Culture is all around us in architecture, art, food, fashion and language. We want to overturn the negative views of Sheffield by showcasing the city's vibrant culture and inviting you to share in discovering, creating and capturing it. It's important to preserve our culture as it's part of our identity as citizens of Sheffield and helps define our perspectives on day-to-day life. Get involved by hitting the streets of Sheffield and sharing what you find. Maybe the Steel City will inspire you to create culture yourself.
